      <item value="Returns an Optional describing the specified value, if non-null, otherwise returns an empty Optional." />
      <item value="Generates a no-args constructor. Will generate an error message if such a constructor cannot be written due to the existence of final fields. Complete documentation is found at the project lombok features page for @Constructor . Even though it is not listed, this annotation also has the onConstructor parameter. See the full documentation for more details. NB: Fields with constraints such as @NonNull will NOT be checked in a @NoArgsConstructor constructor, of course!" />
      <item value="小数位" />
      <item value="Whether or not the Job should remain stored after it is orphaned (no Triggers point to it). If not explicitly set, the default value is false - this method sets the value to true." />
      <item value="This annotation may be used on a field or parameter as a qualifier for candidate beans when autowiring. It may also be used to annotate other custom annotations that can then in turn be used as qualifiers." />
      <item value="Indicates that a bean should be given preference when multiple candidates are qualified to autowire a single-valued dependency. If exactly one 'primary' bean exists among the candidates, it will be the autowired value. This annotation is semantically equivalent to the &lt;bean&gt; element's primary attribute in Spring XML. May be used on any class directly or indirectly annotated with @Component or on methods annotated with @Bean." />
      <item value="Create a predicate to test whether the expression is a member of the argument list." />
      <item value="This annotation must be specified for persistent fields or properties of type java.util.Date and java.util.Calendar. It may only be specified for fields or properties of these types. The Temporal annotation may be used in conjunction with the Basic annotation, the Id annotation, or the ElementCollection annotation (when the element collection value is of such a temporal type." />
      <item value="Returns a copy of this LocalDateTime with the day-of-month altered. If the resulting date-time is invalid, an exception is thrown. The time does not affect the calculation and will be the same in the result. This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call." />
      <item value="Returns a stream consisting of the results of applying the given function to the elements of this stream." />
      <item value="Deletes the file or directory denoted by this abstract pathname. If this pathname denotes a directory, then the directory must be empty in order to be deleted. Note that the java.nio.file.Files class defines the delete method to throw an IOException when a file cannot be deleted. This is useful for error reporting and to diagnose why a file cannot be deleted." />
      <item value="Copy the property values of the given source bean into the target bean. Note: The source and target classes do not have to match or even be derived from each other, as long as the properties match. Any bean properties that the source bean exposes but the target bean does not will silently be ignored. This is just a convenience method. For more complex transfer needs, consider using a full BeanWrapper. 形参: source – the source bean target – the target bean 抛出: BeansException – if the copying failed" />
      <item value="Requires the currently executing Subject to have all of the specified roles. If they do not have the role(s), the method will not be executed and an AuthorizationException is thrown. For example, @RequiresRoles(&quot;aRoleName&quot;); void someMethod(); means someMethod() could only be executed by subjects who have been assigned the 'aRoleName' role. Usage Note: Be careful using this annotation if your application has a dynamic security model where roles can be added and deleted at runtime. If your application allowed the annotated role to be deleted during runtime, the method would not be able to be executed by anyone (at least until a new role with the same name was created again). If you require such dynamic functionality, only the RequiresPermissions annotation makes sense - Permission types will not change during runtime for an application since permissions directly correspond to how the application's functionality is programmed (that is, they reflect the application's functionality only, not who is executing the the functionality)." />
      <item value="Reads up to b.length bytes of data from this input stream into an array of bytes. This method blocks until some input is available." />
      <item value="Returns the credentials associated with the corresponding Subject. A credential verifies one or more of the principals associated with the Subject, such as a password or private key. Credentials are used by Shiro particularly during the authentication process to ensure that submitted credentials during a login attempt match exactly the credentials here in the AuthenticationInfo instance. 返回值: the credentials associated with the corresponding Subject." />
      <item value="Indicates a query method should be considered as modifying query as that changes the way it needs to be executed. This annotation is only considered if used on query methods defined through a Query annotation. It's not applied on custom implementation methods or queries derived from the method name as they already have control over the underlying data access APIs or specify if they are modifying by their name. Queries that require a `@Modifying` annotation include INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and DDL statements." />
      <item value="Specify the selection items that are to be returned in the query result. Replaces the previously specified selection(s), if any. The type of the result of the query execution depends on the specification of the type of the criteria query object created as well as the arguments to the multiselect method. &lt;p&gt; An argument to the multiselect method must not be a tuple- or array-valued compound selection item. &lt;p&gt;The semantics of this method are as follows: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; If the type of the criteria query is &lt;code&gt;CriteriaQuery&amp;060;Tuple&amp;062;&lt;code&gt; (i.e., a criteria query object created by either the &lt;code&gt;createTupleQuery&lt;code&gt; method or by passing a &lt;code&gt;Tuple&lt;code&gt; class argument to the &lt;code&gt;createQuery&lt;code&gt; method), a &lt;code&gt;Tuple&lt;code&gt; object corresponding to the arguments of the &lt;code&gt;multiselect&lt;code&gt; method, in the specified order, will be instantiated and returned for each row that results from the query execution. &lt;li&gt; If the type of the criteria query is &lt;code&gt;CriteriaQuery&amp;060;X&amp;062;&lt;code&gt; for some user-defined class X (i.e., a criteria query object created by passing a X class argument to the &lt;code&gt;createQuery&lt;code&gt; method), the arguments to the &lt;code&gt;multiselect&lt;code&gt; method will be passed to the X constructor and an instance of type X will be returned for each row. &lt;li&gt; If the type of the criteria query is &lt;code&gt;CriteriaQuery&amp;060;X[]&amp;062;&lt;code&gt; for some class X, an instance of type X[] will be returned for each row.

      <item value="A qualifier can be specified to aid the selection process of a suitable mapper. This is useful in case multiple mapping methods (hand written or generated) qualify and thus would result in an 'Ambiguous mapping methods found' error.

      <item value="General-purpose annotation used for configuring details of how values of properties are to be serialized. Unlike most other Jackson annotations, annotation does not have specific universal interpretation: instead, effect depends on datatype of property being annotated (or more specifically, deserializer and serializer being used). Common uses include choosing between alternate representations -- for example, whether java.util.Date is to be serialized as number (Java timestamp) or String (such as ISO-8601 compatible time value) -- as well as configuring exact details with pattern property. As of Jackson 2.6, known special handling includes: java.util.Date: Shape can be JsonFormat.Shape.STRING or JsonFormat.Shape.NUMBER; pattern may contain java.text.SimpleDateFormat-compatible pattern definition. Can be used on Classes (types) as well, for modified default behavior, possibly overridden by per-property annotation Enums: Shapes JsonFormat.Shape.STRING and JsonFormat.Shape.NUMBER can be used to change between numeric (index) and textual (name or toString()); but it is also possible to use JsonFormat.Shape.OBJECT to serialize (but not deserialize) Enums as JSON Objects (as if they were POJOs). NOTE: serialization as JSON Object only works with class annotation; will not work as per-property annotation. java.util.Collections can be serialized as (and deserialized from) JSON Objects, if JsonFormat.Shape.OBJECT is used. NOTE: can ONLY be used as class annotation; will not work as per-property annotation. Number subclasses can be serialized as full objects if JsonFormat.Shape.OBJECT is used. Otherwise the default behavior of serializing to a scalar number value will be preferred. NOTE: can ONLY be used as class annotation; will not work as per-property annotation." />

      <item value="A convenience class to represent name-value pairs." />
      <item value="This is the central class in the JDBC core package. It simplifies the use of JDBC and helps to avoid common errors. It executes core JDBC workflow, leaving application code to provide SQL and extract results. This class executes SQL queries or updates, initiating iteration over ResultSets and catching JDBC exceptions and translating them to the generic, more informative exception hierarchy defined in the org.springframework.dao package. Code using this class need only implement callback interfaces, giving them a clearly defined contract. The PreparedStatementCreator callback interface creates a prepared statement given a Connection, providing SQL and any necessary parameters. The ResultSetExtractor interface extracts values from a ResultSet. See also PreparedStatementSetter and RowMapper for two popular alternative callback interfaces. Can be used within a service implementation via direct instantiation with a DataSource reference, or get prepared in an application context and given to services as bean reference. Note: The DataSource should always be configured as a bean in the application context, in the first case given to the service directly, in the second case to the prepared template. Because this class is parameterizable by the callback interfaces and the org.springframework.jdbc.support.SQLExceptionTranslator interface, there should be no need to subclass it. All SQL operations performed by this class are logged at debug level, using &quot;org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate&quot; as log category. NOTE: An instance of this class is thread-safe once configured." />

      <item value="Whether the browser should send credentials, such as cookies along with cross domain requests, to the annotated endpoint. The configured value is set on the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials response header of preflight requests. NOTE: Be aware that this option establishes a high level of trust with the configured domains and also increases the surface attack of the web application by exposing sensitive user-specific information such as cookies and CSRF tokens. By default this is not set in which case the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header is also not set and credentials are therefore not allowed." />

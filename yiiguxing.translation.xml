      <item value="Adds modifiers to each field in the type with this annotation. Complete documentation is found at the project lombok features page for @FieldDefaults . If makeFinal is true, then each (instance) field that is not annotated with @NonFinal will have the final modifier added. If level is set, then each (instance) field that is package private (i.e. no access modifier) and does not have the @PackagePrivate annotation will have the appropriate access level modifier added." />

      <item value="Specifies a single-valued association to another entity class that has many-to-one multiplicity. It is not normally necessary to specify the target entity explicitly since it can usually be inferred from the type of the object being referenced. If the relationship is bidirectional, the non-owning OneToMany entity side must used the mappedBy element to specify the relationship field or property of the entity that is the owner of the relationship. The ManyToOne annotation may be used within an embeddable class to specify a relationship from the embeddable class to an entity class. If the relationship is bidirectional, the non-owning OneToMany entity side must use the mappedBy element of the OneToMany annotation to specify the relationship field or property of the embeddable field or property on the owning side of the relationship. The dot (&quot;.&quot;) notation syntax must be used in the mappedBy element to indicate the relationship attribute within the embedded attribute. The value of each identifier used with the dot notation is the name of the respective embedded field or property." />

      <item value="the value 0 if the argument string is equal to this string; a value less than 0 if this string is lexicographically less than the string argument; and a value greater than 0 if this string is lexicographically greater than the string argument." />
      <item value="Compares two strings lexicographically. The comparison is based on the Unicode value of each character in the strings. The character sequence represented by this String object is compared lexicographically to the character sequence represented by the argument string. The result is a negative integer if this String object lexicographically precedes the argument string. The result is a positive integer if this String object lexicographically follows the argument string. The result is zero if the strings are equal; compareTo returns 0 exactly when the equals(Object) method would return true. This is the definition of lexicographic ordering. If two strings are different, then either they have different characters at some index that is a valid index for both strings, or their lengths are different, or both. If they have different characters at one or more index positions, let k be the smallest such index; then the string whose character at position k has the smaller value, as determined by using the &lt; operator, lexicographically precedes the other string. In this case, compareTo returns the difference of the two character values at position k in the two string -- that is, the value: this.charAt(k)-anotherString.charAt(k) If there is no index position at which they differ, then the shorter string lexicographically precedes the longer string. In this case, compareTo returns the difference of the lengths of the strings -- that is, the value: this.length()-anotherString.length()" />
      <item value="Sorts this list according to the order induced by the specified Comparator. All elements in this list must be mutually comparable using the specified comparator (that is, c.compare(e1, e2) must not throw a ClassCastException for any elements e1 and e2 in the list). If the specified comparator is null then all elements in this list must implement the Comparable interface and the elements' natural ordering should be used. This list must be modifiable, but need not be resizable." />
      <item value="Accepts a function that extracts a Comparable sort key from a type T, and returns a Comparator&lt;T&gt; that compares by that sort key. The returned comparator is serializable if the specified function is also serializable." />
      <item value="Returns a stream consisting of the elements of this stream, sorted according to natural order. If the elements of this stream are not Comparable, a java.lang.ClassCastException may be thrown when the terminal operation is executed. For ordered streams, the sort is stable. For unordered streams, no stability guarantees are made." />
      <item value="fromIndex – low endpoint (inclusive) of the subList toIndex – high endpoint (exclusive) of the subList" />
      <item value="Returns a view of the portion of this list between the specified fromIndex, inclusive, and toIndex, exclusive. (If fromIndex and toIndex are equal, the returned list is empty.) The returned list is backed by this list, so non-structural changes in the returned list are reflected in this list, and vice-versa. The returned list supports all of the optional list operations supported by this list. This method eliminates the need for explicit range operations (of the sort that commonly exist for arrays). Any operation that expects a list can be used as a range operation by passing a subList view instead of a whole list. For example, the following idiom removes a range of elements from a list: list.subList(from, to).clear(); Similar idioms may be constructed for indexOf and lastIndexOf, and all of the algorithms in the Collections class can be applied to a subList. The semantics of the list returned by this method become undefined if the backing list (i.e., this list) is structurally modified in any way other than via the returned list. (Structural modifications are those that change the size of this list, or otherwise perturb it in such a fashion that iterations in progress may yield incorrect results.)" />
      <item value="Creates a string representation of this Date object in an implementation-dependent form.

      <item value="Copy the property values of the given source bean into the target bean. Note: The source and target classes do not have to match or even be derived from each other, as long as the properties match.

      <item value="Requires the currently executing Subject to have all of the specified roles. If they do not have the role(s), the method will not be executed and an AuthorizationException is thrown. For example, @RequiresRoles(&quot;aRoleName&quot;); void someMethod(); means someMethod() could only be executed by subjects who have been assigned the 'aRoleName' role. Usage Note: Be careful using this annotation if your application has a dynamic security model where roles can be added and deleted at runtime. If your application allowed the annotated role to be deleted during runtime, the method would not be able to be executed by anyone (at least until a new role with the same name was created again). If you require such dynamic functionality, only the RequiresPermissions annotation makes sense - Permission types will not change during runtime for an application since permissions directly correspond to how the application's functionality is programmed (that is, they reflect the application's functionality only, not who is executing the the functionality)." />

      <item value="General-purpose annotation used for configuring details of how values of properties are to be serialized. Unlike most other Jackson annotations, annotation does not have specific universal interpretation: instead, effect depends on datatype of property being annotated (or more specifically, deserializer and serializer being used). Common uses include choosing between alternate representations -- for example, whether java.util.Date is to be serialized as number (Java timestamp) or String (such as ISO-8601 compatible time value) -- as well as configuring exact details with pattern property. As of Jackson 2.6, known special handling includes: java.util.Date: Shape can be JsonFormat.Shape.STRING or JsonFormat.Shape.NUMBER; pattern may contain java.text.SimpleDateFormat-compatible pattern definition. Can be used on Classes (types) as well, for modified default behavior, possibly overridden by per-property annotation Enums: Shapes JsonFormat.Shape.STRING and JsonFormat.Shape.NUMBER can be used to change between numeric (index) and textual (name or toString()); but it is also possible to use JsonFormat.Shape.OBJECT to serialize (but not deserialize) Enums as JSON Objects (as if they were POJOs). NOTE: serialization as JSON Object only works with class annotation; will not work as per-property annotation. java.util.Collections can be serialized as (and deserialized from) JSON Objects, if JsonFormat.Shape.OBJECT is used. NOTE: can ONLY be used as class annotation; will not work as per-property annotation. Number subclasses can be serialized as full objects if JsonFormat.Shape.OBJECT is used. Otherwise the default behavior of serializing to a scalar number value will be preferred. NOTE: can ONLY be used as class annotation; will not work as per-property annotation." />

      <item value="General-purpose annotation used for configuring details of how values of properties are to be serialized. Unlike most other Jackson annotations, annotation does not have specific universal interpretation: instead, effect depends on datatype of property being annotated (or more specifically, deserializer and serializer being used). Common uses include choosing between alternate representations -- for example, whether java.util.Date is to be serialized as number (Java timestamp) or String (such as ISO-8601 compatible time value) -- as well as configuring exact details with pattern property. As of Jackson 2.6, known special handling includes: java.util.Date: Shape can be JsonFormat.Shape.STRING or JsonFormat.Shape.NUMBER; pattern may contain java.text.SimpleDateFormat-compatible pattern definition. Can be used on Classes (types) as well, for modified default behavior, possibly overridden by per-property annotation Enums: Shapes JsonFormat.Shape.STRING and JsonFormat.Shape.NUMBER can be used to change between numeric (index) and textual (name or toString()); but it is also possible to use JsonFormat.Shape.OBJECT to serialize (but not deserialize) Enums as JSON Objects (as if they were POJOs). NOTE: serialization as JSON Object only works with class annotation; will not work as per-property annotation. java.util.Collections can be serialized as (and deserialized from) JSON Objects, if JsonFormat.Shape.OBJECT is used. NOTE: can ONLY be used as class annotation; will not work as per-property annotation. Number subclasses can be serialized as full objects if JsonFormat.Shape.OBJECT is used. Otherwise the default behavior of serializing to a scalar number value will be preferred. NOTE: can ONLY be used as class annotation; will not work as per-property annotation." />

      <item value="A convenience class to represent name-value pairs." />
      <item value="This is the central class in the JDBC core package. It simplifies the use of JDBC and helps to avoid common errors. It executes core JDBC workflow, leaving application code to provide SQL and extract results. This class executes SQL queries or updates, initiating iteration over ResultSets and catching JDBC exceptions and translating them to the generic, more informative exception hierarchy defined in the org.springframework.dao package. Code using this class need only implement callback interfaces, giving them a clearly defined contract. The PreparedStatementCreator callback interface creates a prepared statement given a Connection, providing SQL and any necessary parameters. The ResultSetExtractor interface extracts values from a ResultSet. See also PreparedStatementSetter and RowMapper for two popular alternative callback interfaces. Can be used within a service implementation via direct instantiation with a DataSource reference, or get prepared in an application context and given to services as bean reference. Note: The DataSource should always be configured as a bean in the application context, in the first case given to the service directly, in the second case to the prepared template. Because this class is parameterizable by the callback interfaces and the org.springframework.jdbc.support.SQLExceptionTranslator interface, there should be no need to subclass it. All SQL operations performed by this class are logged at debug level, using &quot;org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate&quot; as log category. NOTE: An instance of this class is thread-safe once configured." />

      <item value="Returns, if this stream is ordered, a stream consisting of the remaining elements of this stream after dropping the longest prefix of elements that match the given predicate. Otherwise returns, if this stream is unordered, a stream consisting of the remaining elements of this stream after dropping a subset of elements that match the given predicate. If this stream is ordered then the longest prefix is a contiguous sequence of elements of this stream that match the given predicate. The first element of the sequence is the first element of this stream, and the element immediately following the last element of the sequence does not match the given predicate. If this stream is unordered, and some (but not all) elements of this stream match the given predicate, then the behavior of this operation is nondeterministic; it is free to drop any subset of matching elements (which includes the empty set). Independent of whether this stream is ordered or unordered if all elements of this stream match the given predicate then this operation drops all elements (the result is an empty stream), or if no elements of the stream match the given predicate then no elements are dropped (the result is the same as the input)." />
      <item value="The custom pattern to use to format the field or method parameter. Defaults to empty String, indicating no custom pattern String has been specified. Set this attribute when you wish to format your field or method parameter in accordance with a custom date time pattern not represented by a style or ISO format. Note: This pattern follows the original java.text.SimpleDateFormat style, as also supported by Joda-Time, with strict parsing semantics towards overflows (e.g. rejecting a Feb 29 value for a non-leap-year). As a consequence, 'yy' characters indicate a year in the traditional style, not a &quot;year-of-era&quot; as in the java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter specification (i.e. 'yy' turns into 'uu' when going through a DateTimeFormatter with strict resolution mode)." />
